(Default disable)(experimental)  
Crossbow can shot tnt, fire_charge(small_fireball), ender_pearl.  
You still need a arrow, it will return to your inventory.  
More items comes when 1.20.3, it looks there is a small change.  
There're some small bugs that doesn't affect the functions.  
Better than [Crossbow Cartridges](https://modrinth.com/datapack/gm4-crossbow-cartridges),
